  "content": "Hi. This is my first post on my first personal blog. I haven't had a blog before as I hadn't felt the need to do so. But times have changed, and now I feel otherwise. This website contains all the projects I have and am working on, my blog posts and a page about me. I will be writing more posts in the weeks to come. I guess I should introduce myself. Hi. My name is Fadil Eledath. I'm an Indian living in Dubai, a city that's awesome. I hope you enjoy using the stuff that i will be developing in the years to come. I already have two projects that I have forgotten to mention in the projects page: <a href='http://www.maverickyouth.com'>Maverick Youth</a> and iTools. I am going to be taking down iTools and putting all of the tools on GitHub under an OpenSource license for others to use. I will also be creating a couple of jQuery plugins in my spare time. But before all that, I will be finishing the design of by website."
