		<p>Ever since I made my first robotic pet as a ten-year-old, I’ve been passionately working on building robotic systems that attempt to address real-world problems.</p>
		<p>I’m an active participant in robotics and innovation competitions at national and international levels. I also enjoy volunteering and mentoring fresh robotic enthusiasts at Fun Robotics, a local robotics club. </p>

		<p>My other passion, coding and platform building led me to co-found Maverick Youth and DelegatePal which have benefited thousands of students around the world.</p>
